# Project Assignment: Deploy a Web Server on Azure

## Objective

In this project, you will create a basic web server using a Virtual Machine (VM) on Microsoft Azure through the Azure portal. You will:

- Create a Resource Group.
- Set up a Virtual Network (VNet).
- Deploy a Linux Virtual Machine.
- Install a web server on the VM.
- Test the web server via a browser.

---

## Task Overview

### 1. Create a Resource Group

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the left-hand menu, click on **Resource Groups**.
3. Click **+ Create** at the top.
4. Choose your **Subscription** and enter a name for the Resource Group (e.g., `WebServerResourceGroup`).
5. Select a **Region** (e.g., `East US`) close to your location.
6. Click **Review + Create**, then click **Create**.

**Tip:**  
A resource group is a container that holds related resources for your Azure solution.

### 2. Create a Virtual Network (VNet)

1. In the left-hand menu, search for **Virtual networks** and select it.
2. Click **+ Create** at the top.
3. Select your subscription and the **Resource Group** you created earlier (`WebServerResourceGroup`).
4. Provide a **Name** for your VNet (e.g., `WebServerVNet`).
5. Choose a region for the VNet (e.g., `East US`).
6. Click on **IP Addresses** from the tab options at the top:
   - In the **IPv4 address space**, enter `10.0.0.0/16`.
   - In **Subnets**, click on **+ Add subnet**:
     - **Subnet name:** Enter `WebServerSubnet`.
     - **Subnet address range:** Enter `10.0.1.0/24`.
7. Click **Review + Create**, then click **Create**.

**Hint:**  
- The **address space** and **subnet** define the IP ranges for your virtual network and subnet. These can be adjusted based on your needs.

### 3. Create a Virtual Machine

1. In the left-hand menu, search for **Virtual Machines** and select it.
2. Click **+ Create** and choose **Azure Virtual Machine**.
3. In the **Basics** tab:
   - Select your subscription and resource group (`WebServerResourceGroup`).
   - Choose a **Virtual Machine Name** (e.g., `WebServerVM`).
   - Select your region (`East US`).
   - Under **Image**, choose **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** (or another Linux distribution).
   - Choose a size for the VM (e.g., **Standard B1s**, which is a low-cost option).
   - Under **Administrator Account**, choose **SSH public key** for authentication.
   - Enter a username (e.g., `azureuser`).
   - If you don't already have SSH keys, click **Generate new key pair**.
4. In the **Networking** tab:
   - Under **Virtual network**, select the **WebServerVNet** you created earlier.
   - In **Subnet**, choose **WebServerSubnet**.
5. Click **Review + Create**, then click **Create**.

**Tip:**  
- Ensure you save the **SSH private key** if you generated a new key pair, as it will be used to access the VM.
- After deployment, the VMâ€™s public IP address will be displayed. Make sure to note it down.

### 4. Allow HTTP Traffic (Port 80) for Web Access

1. Go back to your **Virtual Machine** (from the left-hand menu or your Resource Group).
2. Click on the **Networking** tab on the left.
3. Under **Inbound port rules**, click **Add inbound port rule**.
4. Set the following values:
   - **Destination port ranges**: `80`
   - **Protocol**: TCP
   - **Action**: Allow
   - **Name**: Allow-HTTP
5. Click **Add**.

**Hint:**  
This step ensures that your VM will allow incoming traffic on port 80, which is used for web server communication.

### 5. Connect to the VM and Install Apache Web Server

#### Steps to SSH into your VM:

1. Go to your **Virtual Machine** overview page in Azure.
2. Find the **Public IP address** and note it down.
3. Open a terminal on your local machine (or use an SSH client like PuTTY on Windows).
4. Use the following command to connect to the VM:

   ```bash
   ssh azureuser@<Your_VM_Public_IP>
   ```

5. Once logged in, update the package list and install Apache web server:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install apache2 -y
   ```

6. After the installation is complete, start Apache:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start apache2
   ```

**Tip:**  
- Replace `<Your_VM_Public_IP>` with the actual public IP address of your VM.
- To check if Apache is running, use `sudo systemctl status apache2`.

---

### 6. Test the Web Server

1. Once Apache is installed and running, open your browser and navigate to your VM's public IP address:

   ```
   http://<Your_VM_Public_IP>
   ```

2. You should see the default Apache welcome page if everything is set up correctly.

---

## Bonus: Customize Your Web Page

1. After installing Apache, navigate to the web server's root directory:

   ```bash
   cd /var/www/html
   ```

2. Edit the `index.html` file using a text editor, such as `nano`, to personalize the web page:

   ```bash
   sudo nano index.html
   ```

3. Modify the content to say something like "Welcome to My First Azure Web Server!" and save the file.

4. Reload the web page in your browser to see the changes.

---

## Clean Up Resources (Optional)

To avoid unnecessary costs, you can delete the resources once you're done with the project:

1. In the left-hand menu, select **Resource Groups**.
2. Click on the resource group (`WebServerResourceGroup`).
3. Click **Delete Resource Group** at the top.
4. Confirm the deletion by typing the resource group name.

## Summary

In this project, you:

- Created a Resource Group and a Virtual Network.
- Set up a Linux Virtual Machine via the Azure portal.
- Installed and configured Apache web server.
- Tested your web server by accessing it from a browser.

---

### Additional Tips

- If you need help navigating the Azure portal, refer to the [Azure Virtual Machine Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/overview).
- Double-check that your VM is running in the same region as your VNet to avoid latency issues.

This project will help participants understand the basics of Azure resource management, networking, and how to set up a simple web server in the cloud using the Azure portal.
